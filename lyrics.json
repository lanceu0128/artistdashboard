I just don't understand, understand\nAnd by the way, where's my dad?\nFather, please forgive me for I know not what I do\nI just never had the chance to ever meet you\nTherefore I did not know that I would grow to be\nMy mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds\n\nPredominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly\nPredominantly-white, predominantly black. Well, what about me?\nWhere does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em\nI think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream\nWhile I'm projectile vomitin'; what do I look like, a comedian to you?\nDo you think that I'm kiddin'? What do I look like, some kinda idi...\nWait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am I so misunderstood?\nWhy do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish\n\"Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions\nAnd his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in\nAnd the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad\nAnd how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it\nMan, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it\nI can't imagine it. That little rich, poor, white bastard\nNeeds to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it\nMan, if I only had half of it\"\nShit, if you only knew the half of it...\nHaha\n\nFather, please forgive me for I know not what I do\nI just never had the chance to ever meet you\nTherefore I did not know that I would grow to be\nMy mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds\n\nEvil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds\nPlease release me from these demons\nI never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please believe\nI don't wanna be Satan's spawn\nNever got the chance to say I'm sorry\nNow look at all the pain I caused\nDear Santa Claus, why are you not comin' this year again?\nWhat did I do that was so bad to deserve this?\nEverything could have been so perfect\nBut life ain't a fairytale. I'm about to be hoisted up in the air\nForty feet below me there's people everywhere\nI don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel\nAnd all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel\nWithout this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round\nHere we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now\nRing-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now\nBut the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be\nWhere's the switch I could just turn off-and-on? This ain't what I chose to be\nSo please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on\n'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone\nFather, please forgive me for I know not what I do\nI just never had the chance to ever meet you\nTherefore I did not know that I would grow to be\nMy mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds\nI said, Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do\nI just never had the chance to ever meet you\nTherefore I did not know that I would grow to be\nMy mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds\n(Evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)\n\n\nOh!\nLast one, baby, let's go\nLast one, baby, let's go\nDetroit!54"

Mash on him, let him have it\nMeanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction\nSome receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk\nHas an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection\nTries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record\nBut now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up\nWas through that publication, the same one that made me famous\nNow the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?\nWell, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!\nBut I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think\nThat we've just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.\nAnd he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind\nWe still have soldiers that's on the front line\nWho's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders\nNever to extort us, strictly to show they support us\nAnd maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus\nTo show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important\nIt is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners\nTheir loyalty to us is worth more than any award is\nBut I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered\nIt ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\nThan to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict\nI'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further\nBut don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'\nI'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'\nOff at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'\nI'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience\n'Cause\u2014\nStep by step, heart to heart\nLeft, right, left, we all fall down\nLike toy soldiers\nBit by bit, torn apart\nWe never win, but the battle wages on\nFor toy soldiers220"

So much for first single on this one\n\nShady's the label, Aftermath is the stable\nThat the horses come out of\u2014erra\nOf course we're about to stir up\nSome shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup\nIt's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason\nOther than to\u2014just to tease him\n'Cause he was his biggest (*burp*) fan\nHe used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'\nLiquor on the curb in his name for him\n\"Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker\nI'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said.\"\nIt goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show\nReady, get set, let's go\nHere comes the buckin' bronco\nStompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo\nSoldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo\nMotherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll\nAround and around I go\nWhen will I stop? I don't know\nTryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off\nBut I know anything's possible\nThough I'm not gonna top what I sold\nI'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change\nLong as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away\nWith murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today\nWe keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes\nIn a safe, locked 'em away (*slam*)\nBetter watch what you say\nJust when you thought you were safe\nThem fuckers got you on tape\nYou swear to God you was playin'\nWhether or not you was little Joshua\nGosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same\n'Cause one day it could cost you your name\nAnd this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)\nBut I just fucked that up, so\nFuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)\nSlap a bitch and smack a ho\nThis was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)\nThat you hear on your radio\nBut shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra\nOh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra\nOh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah\nOh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra\nOh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka\n\nEri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills\nAnd woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked\nJig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID\nTo sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly\nHee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and na\u00efve\nOh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree\nParis and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish\nEvery picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks\nHickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry\nWith these words \u2013 am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?\nOr chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain\nTwenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?\nWait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back\nAnd rewind it {blblblblblblblb} \u2013 wait, let me ask you again\nAm I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?\nOr am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang\nCameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade\nPornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle\nJigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered\nBritney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'\nWhen they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club\nAnd dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em\n'Cause they could've sworn someone said, \"Ni\u2014\"\nAnd then tried to erase and record over it\nBut if you listen close enough to it you can hear the\n\"Ga-hu\" and then they come to\nFind out it was Justin sayin', \"I'm gon\u2014nuh cum!\"\n\nAnd this was supposed to be. my first single (*burp*)\nBut I just fucked that up, so\nFuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)\nSlap a bitch and smack a ho\nThis was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)\nThat you hear on your radio\nBut shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra\nOh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra\nOh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah\nOh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra\nOh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka\n\nAny opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest\nAnd address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it\nAll you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number\nIt's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK\nAnd if someone picks up\nYou can talk all the shit you want about me\nJust type in your number back and follow it by the pound key\nAnd I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day\nThat I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)\nSo fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken\nEat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!\nOr suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth\nI'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off!\nAnd this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)\nBut I just fucked that up, so\nFuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)\nSlap a bitch and smack a ho\nThis was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)\nThat you hear on your radio\nBut shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)\nOh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra\nOh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra\nOh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah\nOh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra\nOh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka (*burp*)31"

'Cause it's getting expensive\nBeing on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive\nThey say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain\nWhen I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses\nI say you're all just too goddamn sensitive\nIt's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous\nLet's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this\nAnd Chris-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither\nAnd let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either\nHe used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I\nHad one of those 25-cent stickers on my refrigerator\nRight next to Darth Vader\nAnd Darth must've put a hex on him for later\nI feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that\nI stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor\nI killed Superman, I killed Super\u2014\nMan, and how ironic\nThat I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic\n'Cause I ain't got no legs\nOr no brain\nNice to meet you\nHi, my name is...\nI forgot my name\nMy aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame\nMy soul is possessed by this devil\nMy new name is... Rain Man\n\nNow in the Bible, it says:\n\"Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed\nHave homosexual sex\nUnless, of course, you were given the consent to join in\nThen, of course, it's intercourse, and it's bisexual sex\nWhich isn't as bad\n'Long as you show some remorse for your actions\nEither before, during, or after\nPerforming the act of that which\nIs normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases\nThat are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way\nBut who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?\"\nLet's ask Dr. Dre\u2014Dr. Dre? (What up?)\nI got a question, if I may (Yeah)\nIs it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend? (Yeah)\nAnd watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)\nBut up, I ain't done yet\nIn football, the quarterback yells out, \"Hut-hut\"\nWhile he reaches in another grown man's ass\nGrabs on his nuts, but, just, what if\nIt was never meant\u2014it was just an accident\nBut he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in\u2014\nHis teeny-tiny, little, round heinie, and he didn't mean it\nBut his little weenie flinched just a little bit\nAnd I don't need to go into any more details, but\nWhat if he pictured it as a female's butt?\nIs that gay? I just need to clear things up\n'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because\n\n'Cause I ain't got no legs\nOr no brain\nNice to meet you\nHi, my name is...\nI forgot my name\nMy aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame\nMy soul is possessed by this devil\nMy new name is Rain Man\n\nYou find me offensive, I find you offensive\u2014\nShit, this is the same verse, I just did this\nWhen am I gonna come to my good senses?\nProbably the day Bush comes to my defenses\nMy spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby\nAnd my plan is to get him next and\nOpen up a whoop-ass canister\nGod damn it, Dre, where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)\nAnyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it\nThis is the only thing that I'm good at\nI am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic\nDemonic\u2014yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it\nI got it, high-five Nick Lachey\nStuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away (*Pfffffff*)\nAnd as she flew around the room like a balloon, I\nGrabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can, and zoom, I\nHeaded straight back to the Neverland Ranch\nWith a peanut butter-jelly-chicken-tuna sandwich\nAnd I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense\nI just did a whole song, and I didn't say shit\n'Cause I ain't got no legs\nOr no brain\nNice to meet you\nHi, my name is...\nI forgot my name\nMy aim was not to become what I became\nWith this level of fame\nMy soul is possessed by this devil\nMy new name is Rain Man\n\n'Cause ah, uh, ah, eh, ugh...\nYup, Rain Man\nDefinitely, definitely Dr. Dre\nSuper-dope beatmaker\n2000 and, 2000 and\nFour-hundred-and-eighty-seven-million-nine-hundred-and-se-\n-Seventy-three-thousand-four-hundred-and-sixty-three...\nAnd seventy\nYeah70"

Pippity-kaka-poo-poo\nPsych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening\nOkay, now I need your undivided attention\nSir, I have a question, why do I always sense this undeniable tension?\nFrom the moment that I enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers\nWhenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?\nI've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...\n\nYou're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do\nSo instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say\nAll kinds of really mean things about me\n'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie\nBut it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me\n'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot\nWhen you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see\nYou're really just a big weenie, big weenie\n\nAlright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line\nI was going to say something extremely important\nBut I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up\nPsych, I'm kidding again, you idiot, no, I didn't\nThat's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?\nBut I can bust one take without looking at no paper\nIt doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day\nFor me to say the truth, okay? You're drooling, you have tooth decay\nYour mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?\nA bunch of sweets or something? What, you munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?\nYour tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?\n\"Yes, I do, sir, what am I on?\" You, sir, are on truth serum\n\"Marshall, I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody\nI'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified\nThat someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible\nEvil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities\"\n\nYou're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do\nSo instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say\nAll kinds of really mean things about me\n'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie\nBut it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me\n'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot\nWhen you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see\nYou're really just a big weenie, big weenie\nAlright, now we, we're going to conduct\nThat experiment that we were talking about earlier\nJust to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy\n'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?\nHere's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?\nWait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror\nHow 'bout now? What do you have in common?\nYou're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em\nYou look like I sound like singing about weenies\nNow take my weenie out of your mouth\nThis is between me and you, I know you're not happy\nI know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying\nCurled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying\nThat my weenie is much bigger than yours is\nMine is like sticking a banana between two oranges\nWhy are you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless\nWhy do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous\nMy point is this\nThat if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink\nNow I forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...\n\nYou're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do\nSo instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say\nAll kinds of really mean things about me\n'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie\nBut it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me\n'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot\nWhen you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see\nYou're really just a big weenie, big weenie\n\nFuck off my dick33"

Who would'a even thought possibly\nCupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?\nIt's true that I got shot in the heart\nBut when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are\nBut see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see\n'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach\nUp under the seat as your heart starts to beat\nBefore you make a decision that's life-altering\nAnd just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave\nYou hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring\n\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)\nI never thought I'd find someone to be mine\nLord knows I was right, \u2018cause you just crossed the line\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)\n\nHa, ha, yeah right, bitch\nSpend some time on my dick\n\nIn most cases, Stat's attitude is, \"Fuck a bitch!\"\nMy only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch\nBut you was different, thought we shared a covenant\nEven held your hand in pub-a-lic\nWe sufferin' because of this\nShawty on some whole 'nother other shit\nTryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip\nI'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit\nFeedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss\nWe started off closer than close\nBut who could've predicted to know\nYour trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?\nAnd the final result, back in that same boat\nI asked myself: \"Do I love these hoes?\" \u2014 Nope!\n(Yeah) Em introduced us: \"50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50\"\nThen slid off and left her to kick it with me\nI complimented her, I said, \"You have very nice lips.\"\nWith my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick\nWe played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast\nHad her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass\nDowntown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline\nPenthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind\nShe got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too\nWhy talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?\nSaid she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice\nYeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit? (Ha-ha!)\n\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine\nI never thought I'd find someone to be mine\nLord knows I was right, \u2018cause you just crossed the line\nSpend some time with me, say that you'll be mine46"

Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'\nTogether ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something\nWe have no control over, and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Momma's gon' be alright\n\nHeh, it's funny\nI remember back one year when Daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree\nAnd said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'\n'Cause Daddy felt like a bum\u2014see, Daddy had a job but his job\nWas to keep the food on the table for you and Mom and at the time\nEvery house that we lived in either kept gettin'\nBroken into and robbed or shot up on the block and your Mom\nWas savin' money for you in a jar\nTryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurts so bad it broke your Momma's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\nMom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back\nOn to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment\nAnd Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when Daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre  and flew you and Momma out to see me\nBut Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me\nThen you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand it\nPapa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here\nLainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\nShh! Momma's only gone for the moment\n\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why\nWe fear how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise, momma's gon' be alright\nAnd if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'ma give you the world, I'ma buy a diamond ring for you\nI'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'ma break that birdie's neck\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat\nDon't fuck with Dad!

Nigga, fuck my wife\nI'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life\nOh, shit! The shooter's coming\nBitches hollering, niggas running\nPeople, shot all over the floor\nAnd I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door\n(Hey, man) ...That's the sound of the Glock\nEven DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot\nI done messed around, and forgot my TEC\nI don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex\n\n(Kuniva, you alright?) These niggas is tripping (Where's Bizarre at?)

They comin' with bombs, I'm comin' with flare guns\nWe as Americans, we as Americans\nUs as a citizen gotta protect ourselves\nLook at how shit has been, we better check ourselves\nLivin' up in these streets through worse and through better health\nSurvivin' by any means, we as Americans\nUs as a citizen, we are Samaritans\nWhat do we get us in? We better check ourselves\nLook at how shit has been, take a look where you live\nThis is America, and we are Americans\n\nI make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests\nDrama hangin' over my head like a voodoo hex\nI coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest\nWith you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest\nBut I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy\nEver since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50\nIt's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker\nThan makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty\nFuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents\nI'd rather see the President \nIt's never been said, but I set precedents\nAnd the standards and they can't stand it\nMy name shoulda been \"Bastard,\" the shit shoulda been plastered\nOn my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted\nI shoulda been had a cap put in my ass\nBut I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it\nI'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot \u2014 fuck that shit!\nI done seen how fast this rap shit\nCan turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click\nBut this time, they got the fuckin' automatic\nAin't no one gon' test this man \u2014 clack (*click*)\n\nWe as Americans, us as a citizen\nGotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been\nWe better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets\nThrough worse and through better health, survivin' by any means\nWe as Americans, us as a citizen\nWe are Samaritans, what do we get us in?\nWe better check ourselves, look at how shit has been\nTake a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans\n\n(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us\nI tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis\nUnder my long johns, under my Sean Johns\nOne run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone\nI'ma do five years \u2014 no less than that, no questions asked\nSo it might be a good idea that I stop right here\nAnd quit while I'm ahead, already in the red\nAlready got a steady infrared meant for my head\nA target on my back, bigger problems than that\nBin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task\nI ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack\nThey ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back\n\nWe as Americans, us as a citizen\nGotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been\nWe better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets\nThrough worse and through better health, survivin' by any means\nWe as Americans, us as a citizen\nWe are Samaritans, what do we get us in?\nWe better check ourselves, look at how shit has been\nTake a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans56"

One, two, three!\n\nThe more you put me through\nThe more it makes me wanna come back to you\nYou say you hate me, I just love you more\nYou don't want me, I just want you more\nI buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me\nI know it's sad but it's makin' me happy\nThe more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on\n'Cause you love me and I love you more\nIt's sick, but who could ever predict we'd be doin' the same shit?\nWe say we do it for our baby, but we don't\nWe do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one\nOf us trust each other, so we fuck till we bust\nAnd we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout\nTill I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house\nI throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth\nFist fight 'til we turn this mother out\nThen apologize after, laughter, pain\nIt's insane, we're back in the same chapter again\nAnd it's sad, but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you\nThere ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause\u2014\n\nThe more you put me through\nThe more it makes me wanna come back to you\nYou say you hate me, I just love you more\nYou don't want me, I just want you more\nI buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me\nI know it's sad, but it's makin' me happy\nThe more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on\n'Cause you love me and I love you more\n\n'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?\nGood, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry\nIt makes me wanna just take you and just throw you\nOn the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you\nYou fuck other people and I fuck other people\nYou're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil\nIn our ways, but neither one of us would ever admit it\n'Cause one of us would have one up on the other, so forget it\nWe can make accusations, people spread rumors\nBut they ain't got proof, till they do it's just the two of us\nIt's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me\nBut you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed\nIf you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' \u2014 yeah, I would\n'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to\nThat would be this soft and warm?\nSo it's off and on, usually more off than on\nBut at least we know that we share this common bond\nYou're the only one I can fuck without a condom on\nI hope the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact\nAnd plus, I can bust in that, and that's why\u2014\n\nThe more you put me through\nThe more it makes me wanna come back to you\nYou say you hate me, I just love you more\nYou don't want me, I just want you more\nI buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me\nI know it's sad but it's makin' me happy\nThe more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on\n'Cause you love me and I love you more\n\nI can never understand it, that's why I don't try\nFrom junior high until we both die, it's silly\nOh, why must we try? Is it really so rough\nThat we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?\nTry to pull each other's legs until the other begs\nWe're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah\n'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'\nAll we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night\nAnd it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage\nWe both have, we both feel like we've been upstaged\nBy someone else, we've both been someone else's\n\"Someone else,\" problem is neither one wants help\nIt's an addiction and it can't be fixed\nOur family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix\nAnd it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit\nAnd anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit\nAnd they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time\nOn every song, every lyric in every rhyme\nAll the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo\nWhat you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do\nBut I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love\nYou wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up\nThis time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what\nYou do it again, I'm fuckin' you up no matter what\nNo matter what you say, or what you do\nI'mma hunt you down till I find you\nNo matter where you run, I'll be right there\nRight behind you in your nightmares\nSo I brought you the flowers and the candy\nAll the times that you threw it back at me\nTold me you hate me, you gon' hate me more\nWhen you find out you can't escape me, whore\n\nThe more you put me through\nThe more it makes me wanna come back to you\nYou say you hate me, I just love you more\nYou don't want me, I just want you more\nI buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me\nI know it's sad but it's makin' me happy\nThe more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on\n'Cause you love me, and I love you more51"

I mean when she was still bloated\nBefore they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!)\nAnybody I throw flames at gets a name\nIt's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same\nIt's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame\nEvery day it's the same thing, people in this game\nTry to buddy-buddy us\nJust to get close enough to study us, everybody just wants\nTo have something to do with that\nThey all trying to get that stamp, they after that Shady/Aftermath money\nIt's like a monopoly\nThey probably just now finally understand \"How to Rob\" fully\n50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me\nAnd Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery\nAnd the damn slot machine at the same time as each other\nWhy the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?\nWhen we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered\nThat we had more in common than we thought with each other\nBoth robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us\nWhat was wrong with us, was it our fault?\n'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us\nTwo odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time\nWhat a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica\nQueens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause\nBig L had just got popped just a month before\nIf 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia\nTwo years later, me and Doc had to come, and, uhh-\nOperate, that's when he popped up at number one\nAnd we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering\nEven if I'm under the gun\nYou ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye\nThere'll always be animosity between you and I\nBut see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit\nI'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual\nEgos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all\nSwallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call\nNikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?\nYou gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats\nStomping, I been romping\nSince Tim Dog was hollering \"Fuck Compton\"\nI was whiling, freestyling\nBack when they were still making Maxell cassettes\nI wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that\nAny doubts in your head, that seals the shit\nRicky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc\nStill with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc\nAnd ya' don't stop31"

We love you\nHow many people are proud to be citizens\nOf this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars\nFor the rights that men have died for to protect?\nThe women and men who have broke their necks\nFor the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold\u2026\u00a0or so we're told\n(Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)\n\nI never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see\nSo many motherfuckin' people who feel like me\nWho share the same views and the same exact beliefs\nIt's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me\nSo many lives I touched, so much anger aimed\nIn no particular direction, just sprays and sprays\nAnd straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays\n'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days\nWho would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair\nWith some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear\nThat I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?\nHow could I predict my words would have an impact like this?\nI must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office\n'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems\nAnd now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government\nI'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on\nWhite America! I could be one of your kids\nWhite America! Little Eric looks just like this\nWhite America! Erica loves my shit\nI go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)\nWhite America! I could be one of your kids\nWhite America! Little Eric looks just like this\nWhite America! Erica loves my shit\nI go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!\n\nLook at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself\nIf they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf\nBut Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help\nMake ladies swoon, baby (Ooh, baby!) \u2014 Look at my sales!\nLet's do the math: If I was black, I would've sold half\nI ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that\nBut I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back\nGive me the mic! Show me where the fuckin' studio's at\nWhen I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white\nNo labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like\n\"Fuck it,\" until I met Dre, the only one to look past\nGave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass\nHelped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got\nWas prob'ly his in exchange for every white fan that he's got\nLike damn, we just swapped: sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow\nI'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's\u2014\n\nWhite America! I could be one of your kids\nWhite America! Little Eric looks just like this\nWhite America! Erica loves my shit\nI go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)\nWhite America! I could be one of your kids\nWhite America! Little Eric looks just like this\nWhite America! Erica loves my shit\nI go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!\n\nSee, the problem is I speak to suburban kids\nWho otherwise would've never knew these words exist\nWhose moms prob'ly would've never gave two squirts of piss\n'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence\nStraight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came\nAnd kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre\nThat's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in\nAnd they connected with me too, because I looked like them\nThat's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope\nSearchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope\nWaitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat\nWatchin' me while I write this, like, \"I don't like this note!\"\nAll I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy\nSponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early\nSurely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston\nAfter it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom\nSo now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'\nActin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say \"faggot\", shit\nJust look at me like I'm your closest pal\nThe poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for\u2014\nWhite America! I could be one of your kids\nWhite America! Little Eric looks just like this\nWhite America! Erica loves my shit\nI go to TRL, look how many hugs I get! (Yah!)\nWhite America! I could be one of your kids\nWhite America! Little Eric looks just like this\nWhite America! Erica loves my shit\nI go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!\n\nSo to the parents of America, I am the Derringer\nAimed at little Erica to attack her character\nThe ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns\nSent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress\nAnd piss on the lawns of the White House\nTo burn the *galf*\u200b\u200b and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker\nTo spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy\nFuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore!\nFuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!\nHa ha ha, I'm just playin', America\nYou know I love you125"

I bet you're prolly sick of me now\nAin't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!\nI'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)\nI said I'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)\n\nI got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it\nSo before they throw me inside my coffin and close it\nI'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73\nBefore I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD\nI was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months\nMy faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch\n\u2018Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye\nNo, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die\nI look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side\nEven if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try\nTo make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes\nBut I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today\nWhat I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb\nBut the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun\n\u2018Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both\nIt's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show\n\nI'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)\nI said I'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)\n\nNow, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition\nTake a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'\nBut put yourself in my position, just try to envision\nWitnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen\nBitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'\nGoin' through public housing systems, victim of M\u00fcnchausen's Syndrome\nMy whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't\n'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?\nWasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?\nSo you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?\nBut guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely\nAnd Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony\nAnd Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful\nBut you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)\nSee, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong\nBitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!\nBut how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!\nYou selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!\nRemember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)\nWell, guess what? I am dead\u2014dead to you as can be!\nI'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)\nI said I'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet230"

Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n\nEntertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters\nIn the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum\nHoly or unholy, only have one homie\nOnly this gun, lonely \u2018cause don't anyone know me\nYet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)\nI guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great\nOr they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate\nIt's like these kids hang on every single statement we make\nLike they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum\nNow how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?\nFrom standin' on corners and porches just rappin'\nTo havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass\nBut then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you\nFans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you\nTo get they hands on every dime you have\nThey want you to lose your mind every time you mad\nSo they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon\nAny dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns\nThat's why these prosecutors wanna convict me\nStrictly just to get me off of these streets quickly\nBut all they kids be listenin' to me religiously\nSo I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me\nThey're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me\nIf I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B\nIt's all political, if my music is literal\nAnd I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?\nI couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to\nYou're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)\n\n(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n\nThey say music can alter moods and talk to you\nWell, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?\nWell, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude\nJust tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued\nSee, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols\nAnd they wanna get one \u2018cause they think the shit's cool\nNot knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves\nWe entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales\nYou ignoramus, but music is reflection of self\nWe just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail\nIt's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'\nTo bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted\nThat's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing\nExcept for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)\nWho post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long\nIdolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs\nOr for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives\nSo they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die\n'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe\nWe're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes\nThat's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it\nSqueeze it and hold it \u2018cause we consider these minutes golden\nAnd maybe they'll admit it when we're gone\nJust let our spirits live on\nThrough our lyrics that you hear in our songs, so we can\u2014\nSing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\nSing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away330"

Am I just wastin' my time?\nBut then I see my baby\nSuddenly I'm not crazy\nIt all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no\n'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders\n(Fuck, I was scared)\nEveryone's leanin' on me\n\u2018Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over\nBut then she comes back to me\n\nMy baby girl keeps gettin' older\nI watch her grow up with pride\nPeople make jokes \u2018cause they don't understand me\nThey just don't see my real side\nI act like shit don't faze me\nInside it drives me crazy\nMy insecurities could eat me alive\nBut then I see my baby\nSuddenly I'm not crazy\nIt all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no\n\n\u2018Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders\nEveryone's leanin' on me\n\u2018Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over\nBut then she comes back to me\n\nMan, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter\nIf I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father\nTo show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her\nGod, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*\nNow, you probably get this picture from my public persona\nThat I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma\nBut I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest\n\u2018Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of\nMy soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow\nThis boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold\nAnd this load is like the weight of the world\nAnd I think my neck is breakin'\nShould I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?\nNow look, I love my daughter more than life in itself\nBut I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell\nBut I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt\nSo many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else\nBut the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted\nSo here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation\nI've went to jail for this woman\nI've been to bat for this woman\nI've taken bats to people's backs\nBent over backwards for this woman\nMan, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?\nWouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'\nBut fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more\nI got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore\nHailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya\nOur baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner\nAnd suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted\nIt's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted\nAnd\u2014\n\nNow it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders\nEveryone's leanin' on me\n'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier\nNothin' can take her from me\n\nWooo! Told you I can't sing\nOh, well\u2014I tried\nHailie, 'member when I said\nIf you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?\nGuess what\u2014Daddy's here\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere, baby\nI love you (\u200b\u200b*smooch*)\u200b\u200b110"

I'll bet you do!\n*Hailie opens the door*\n*Eminem snorts cocaine*\nWho's your daddy?\nDaddy, what are you doing?\n\nHa-ha!\nOkay then! Everybody, listen up!\nI'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?\nSomebody, please help him!\nI think my dad's gone crazy!\nThere's no mountain I can't climb\nThere's no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly\nWhat do I gotta do to get through to you\nTo show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?\n(Rahhnnn!) Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls\nI cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar\nInside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses\nWith Elton John's name on my drag wall\nI'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off\nAll this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off\n(Suck it, Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off\n'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off\nAnd launch one of these Russians, and that's all\nBlow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off\nWhen will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?\n(*Knocking*) Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it!)\n\nThere's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it\nI think my dad's gone crazy!\nA little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?\nI think my dad's gone crazy!\nThere's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me\nI think my dad's gone crazy!\nThere's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie\nI think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)\n\nIt's like my mother always told me:\n\"Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and\nGoddamn it, you little motherfucker\nIf you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!\"\nUh\u2026 Fuck that shit, bitch!\nEat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick\nAnd lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second\nI'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record\nI'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch\nEat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face\nWith a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows\nQuit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?\nIf y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.\nI wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo\nCatch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more\nAm I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad!)\n\nThere's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it\nI think my dad's gone crazy!\nA little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?\nI think my dad's gone crazy!\nThere's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me\nI think my dad's gone crazy!\nThere's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie\nI think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)\nMy songs can make you cry, take you by surprise\nAt the same time, can make you dry your eyes\nWith the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'\nIs a genius at work, which to me isn't work\nSo it's easy to misinterpret it at first, \u2018cause when I speak\nIt's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth\nBefore I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums\nGet struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once\nAnd die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son\nAnd walk around the rest of my life spit on\nAnd kicked and hit with shit every time I sung\nLike R. Kelly as soon as \"Bump and Grind\" comes on\nMore pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl\nInside of a plane aimed at the World Trade\nStandin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky\n'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade\nAnd that's pretty much the gist of it\nParents are pissed, but the kids love it\n9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers\nI don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither\n\nThere's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it\nI think my dad's gone crazy!\nA little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?\nI think my dad's gone crazy!\nThere's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me\nI think my dad's gone crazy!\nThere's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie\nI think my dad's gone crazy!

Try to understand that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nAnd in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about it, his name was\u2014it was you\nDamn\u2026655"

(Shit)\nYou probably think I'm in your tape deck now\nI'm in the backseat of your truck with duct tape stretched out\nDucked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out\nPut it over your mouth, and grab you by the face \u2014 what now?\nOh, you want me to watch my mouth? How?\nTake my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around? (Look)\nI'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around\nAnd hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out (Oh my God! Oh my God!)\nI'm sorry, there must be a mix-up\nYou want me to fix up lyrics while our president gets his dick sucked?\nFuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts\nMake fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up\nGet aware, wake up, get a sense of humor\nQuit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement (The kids!)\nBut don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace\nYou shoulda been watchin' him, apparently you ain't parents\n\n\u2018Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big\nI never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid\nI never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist\nI never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch\nI never knew I, knew I would get this big\nI never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid\nI never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist\nI never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch\n\nSo who's bringin' the guns in this country?

Ain't they got the same moms\nAnd dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?\nAnd told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?\nWhat about the make-up you allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (Hm?)\nSo tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words\nWhen his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse (Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)\nAnd \"fuck\" was the first word I ever learned\nUp in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)\nSo read up 'bout how I used to get beat up\nPeed on, be on free lunch and changed school every three months\nMy life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)\nFucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike\nSo how much easier would life be if nineteen\nMillion motherfuckers grew to be just like me?\n\n\u2018Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big\nI never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid\nI never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist\nI never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch\nI never knew I, knew I would get this big\nI never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid\nI never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist\nI never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch\nI never knew I, knew I'd have a new house or a new car\nA couple years ago, I was more poorer than you are\nI don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?\nFuck! Shit! Ass! Bitch! Cunt! Shooby-de-doo-wop!

Her? Him? Is it you? Is it them?\n\"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!\"\nDamn, how much damage can you do with a pen?\nMan, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been\nIf you woulda been in my shoes, who woulda thought\nSlim Shady would be somethin' that you woulda bought?\nThat woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop\nI just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not\n\n\u2018Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big\nI never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid\nI never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist\nI never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch\nI never knew I, knew I would get this big\nI never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid\nI never knew I'd get him to slit his wrist\nI never knew I'd get him to hit this bitch\n\nHow the fuck was I supposed to know?57"

I drop bombs, like Hiroshima\nFor this one, they scream \"X, you retarded?!\"\n'Cause I grab the mic and get down like syndrome\nHide and roam into the masses\nWithout boundaries, which qualifies me\nFor the term \u201cuniversal\u201d without no rehearsal\nI leak words that's controversial\nLike I'm not the one you wanna contest, see\n'Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch\nThat got banned from TV, heavyweight getup\nHit you, watch your whole head split up\nLoco is the motion, we comin' through\nHollow-tips is the lead the .45 threw\nRemember me? Throw ya gunz in the air!\nRemember me? Slam! Slam!\nRemember me? Nigga, bacdafucup!\nRemember me? Chka-chka-Onyx!\nNiggas that take no for an answer get told no\nYeah, I been told no, but it was more like \u201cNo! No! No!\u201d\nLife's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her\nBetter come better than better to be a competitor\nThis vet is ahead of the shit, it's all redder, you deader and deader\nA medic instead of the cheddars and credda\nSettle vendetta with metal Beretta from ghetto to ghetto\nEvidence, nope, never leave a shred of\nI got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me\nMy mom's got raped by the industry and made me\nI'm the illest nigga ever, I told you\nI get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total\nWant beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit\nMy name should be Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit\nProbably sayin' he ain't a killer, but I'm killin' myself\nSmoke death, fuck bitches raw on the kitchen floor\nSo think what I'ma do to you, have done to you\nGot niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two\nWhat you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we Glock busters\n'Til the cops cuff us, gon' start ruckus and drop blockbusters\nRound the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us\nI'm gettin' wires, niggas wantin' me dead\nWantin' my head, you think it could be somethin' I said?\n\nRemember me? I just don't give a fuck!\nRemember me? Yeah, fuck you too!\nRemember me? I'm low down and I'm shifty!\nRemember me? I'm Shady!\nWhen I go out, I'ma go out shootin'\nI don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid!\nI'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image\nSo I promised the fuckin' critics I wouldn't say \u201cfuckin''\u201d for six minutes\nSix minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!\nMy baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde\nSo I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on\nI may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts\nIn my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom\nIs she really on as much dope as you say she's on?\nCame home and somebody musta broke in the back window\nAnd stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats\nSix sick dreams of picnic scenes\nTwo kids, sixteen, with M-16's and ten clips each\nAnd them shits reach through six kids each\nAnd Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?!\nFuck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash\nAnd reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match\nAftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at!\n(What the fuck you starin' at, nigga?)\nDon't you remember me?!\nRemember me?!\nRemember me?!\nRemember me!!

Tomorrow, you'll be boys again\nIt's your life, live it however you wanna\nMari-ju-ana is everywhere, where was you brought up?\nIt don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'\n\u2018Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'\nThey tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'\nEven though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'\nBut you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do\nGirls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you\nIf I could take it all back now, I wouldn't\nI would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't\nBut I'm all grown up now and upgraded\nAnd graduated to better drugs and updated\nBut I still got a lotta growing up to do\nI still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew\nBut when it's all said and done, I'll be forty\nBefore I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories\nWith a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap\nBabysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed\n\u2018Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)\nSomething keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)\nI don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\u2018Cause every time I try to tell 'em \"no\" (No)\nThey won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)\nI'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\u2018Cause every time I go to try to leave (Whoa)\nSomething keeps pullin' on my sleeve (Whoa)\nI don't wanna, but I gotta stay (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\u2018Cause every time I try to tell 'em \"no\" (No)\nThey won't let me ever let 'em go (Go)\nI'm a sucker all I gotta say (Whoa)\nThese drugs really got a hold of me (Whoa)\n\nDrugs really got a hold of me\nReally got a hold of me\nThese drugs really got a hold of me\nThey really got a hold of me87"

(Shut up!)\nMr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (He's got AIDS!)\nGood luck, Mr. Shady!\n\nHi there, little boys and girls! (Fuck you!)\nToday we're gonna learn how to poison squirrels\nBut first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)\nSay hi, Bob (\"Hi, Bob!\")\nBob's thirty and still lives with his mom\nAnd he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot\nBut his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot\nAnd Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot\nAnd wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock\nWhen it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog\nDrag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (Ahh!)\nAnd even if they escaped and they got the cops\nThe ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge\n'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job\nWhen she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk\nBut Stacey knew it was Bob and said, \"Knock it off!\"\nBut Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker\nCrazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka\nYou couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor\nHe grabbed Stace' by the legs as he chopped it off her\nAnd dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her\nBut ever since the day Stacey went off to wander\nThey never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner\nAnd that's the story of Bob and his marijuana\nAnd what it might do to you\nSo see if the squirrels want it\u2014it's bad for you\nSee, children, drugs are bad (Come on)\nAnd if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Ask him, man)\nAnd if you don't believe him, ask your mom (That's right)\nShe'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)\nSo kids, say no to drugs (That's right)\nSo you don't act like everyone else does (Uh-huh)\nAnd there's really nothin' else to say (Sing along)\nDrugs are just bad, mmkay?\n\nMy penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?\nFuck, no! You ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut (Huh?)\nSpeakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?\nEcstasy\u2014it's the worst drug in the world\nIf someone ever offers it to you, don't do it\nKids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid\nAnd spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back\nSo don't get attached, or it'll attack every bone in your back\nMeet Zach: twenty-one years old\nAfter hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold\nAnd decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys\nAnd the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it\nSuddenly, he starts to convulse\nAnd his pulse goes into hyperdrive\nAnd his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)\nHis back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches\nHe's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)\nAnd everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him\n\"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!\"\n'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny\nSo they're laughing at basically nothing\nExcept maybe wasting their money\nMeanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over\nAnd his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga\nAnd that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac\nSo don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you\n\nSee, children, drugs are bad (That's right)\nAnd if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)\nAnd if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)\nShe'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)\nSo kids, say no to drugs (Don't smoke crack)\nSo you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)\nAnd there's really nothin' else to say (But umm\u2026)\nDrugs are just bad, mmkay?\n\nAnd last but not least, one of the most humongous\nProblems among young people today is fungus\nIt grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up\nAnd you put it right in your mouth and chew it\nYum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff\nAnd everything slows down when you eat some of 'em\nAnd sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)\nLike fat women in G-strings with orange hair\n(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire\nWomen stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)\nAnd if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms\nWhoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus\nYour tongue gets all swoll up like a cow's tongue\n(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)\nSee, drugs are bad, it's a common fact\nBut your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)\nBut don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD\nThey're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee\nAnd get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault\nSo don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you\nSee, children, drugs are bad (Uh-huh)\nAnd if you don't believe me, ask your dad (Put that down!)\nAnd if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can ask)\nShe'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (And she will)\nSo kids, say no to drugs (Say no)\nSo you don't act like everyone else does (Like I do)\nAnd there's really nothin' else to say (That's right)\nDrugs are just bad, mmkay?\n\nCome on, children, clap along! (Shut up!)\nSing along, children! (Suck my motherfuckin' dick!)\nCome on, clap along\nDrugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)\nSo don't do drugs! (Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)\nSo there'll be more for me (Hippie! Goddamn it!)\n(Mushrooms killed Kenny!)\n(Uh, the fart button's on) (*fart*) (Ew, ahh!)\nLa la la (So fucked up right now)46"

in\u2005here, walking around the party\nA cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby \"The\nBrain\" Heenan which is probably the\nSame reason I wrestle with mania\nShady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up\nConsider it to cross me a costly mistake\nIf they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia\nADHD, Hydroxycut\nPass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)\nIn AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate\nBetter vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)\nThis beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A\nLaughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames\nThey cannot tame or placate the\nMonster\nYou get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)\nI'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)\nWhen the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers\nI look like a villain outta those blockbusters\nGodzilla, fire spitter, monster\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\nFire, Godzilla, fire, monster\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\nI'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls\nHad 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off\nIt's impossible to list 'em all\nAnd in the midst of all this\nI'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball\nTryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?\nRisperdal, voices whisper\nMy fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn\nThis is just the song to go ballistic on\nYou just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher\nI'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological\nQuick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka\nWhen you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a\n\nMonster\nYou get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)\nI'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)\nWhen the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers\nI look like a villain outta those blockbusters\nGodzilla, fire spitter, monster\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\nFire, Godzilla, fire, monster\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\nIf you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand\n'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans\nI'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is\nThe motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)\nHow can I have all these fans and perspire?\nLike a liar's pants, I'm on fire\nAnd I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire\nThese chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer\nI got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers\nAnd what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw\n'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball\nLike Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy\n'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)\nBitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher\nWon't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care\nBut I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her\nFace in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez\nCristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well\nSo they wanna give me the chair\nLike a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari\n'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em\nSwearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious\nIt's time to put these bitches in the obituary column\nWe wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem\nGet the shaft like a steering column (Monster)\nTrigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink\nEvil half of the Bad Meets\nEvil, that means take a back seat\nTake it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single\nLook at my rap sheet, what attracts these people\nIs my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle\nI stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto\nFill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em\nOther words, I Minute Maid 'em\nI don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage\nI'm murderin' again, nobody will evade\nI'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake\nObliterating everything, incinerate a renegade\nI'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid\nBut don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill\nI'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla\nYou're bringin' the killer within me outta me\nYou don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me\nAnd be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be\nEvery bit of me's the epitome of a spitter\nWhen I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck\nOr you finna be dead the minute you run into me\nA hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me\nI'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable\nYou wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable\nI'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable\nI'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full\nI'm not afraid to pull a\u2014\nMan, stop\nLook what I'm plannin', haha1.2K"

Now\nI'm leaving Heaven\nI'm leaving Heaven\nAngels won't find me\nWhere I am going\n\nI've been down, kicked\nLike around six thousand times since I was a kid\nAs a child, picked on, clowned, been\nCountless times I've been doubted\nGotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)\nSo the route I went's self-empowerment\nIn a hole, taught myself how to get out of it\nAnd balance it with talents, wit\n'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)\n'Cause it's only one percent\nWho overcome the shit they've underwent\nI went AWOL like what my back was up against\nDon't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it\nI was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked\nMalcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle\nAnd I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah\nBut I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment\nBesides getting it from both sides of the tracks\nBut I swore I'd get them back\nEven if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)\nThought of a scheme and it got me to thinking\nIf I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it\nThat's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink\nAnd as long as I'm breathing, I vow to outsmart 'em and beat 'em\nMy God, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even\nLike I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end\nThis evil is calling, I'm already seething and\n\nI'm leaving Heaven\nI'm leaving Heaven\nAngels won't find me\nWhere I am going\n\nOkay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)\nI was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)\nLooking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)\nFlippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see\nIf I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat\nIf Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece\nTwenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips\nWe'd be glad to get that even if we had to split\nWe'd do backward flips, looking back at it\nI think that would fit with the definition of not having shit\nCouple that with the fact my mother was batshit\nPop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit\nYeah, which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that I zero had\nSince a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab\nJust to hear them words, ear piercing\nLike my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring\nShould I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died\nMe? Tear no shed\nShould I have made a mural at your funeral?\nHad your coffin draped with a hero's flag?\nWhere the fuck you were at\nWhen De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?\nNever met your grandkids, fucking coward\nOnly guts you had was from your stomach fat\nI couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven\nSo I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell\nSo I can whip your fucking ass\nI hate that I'll never get to say \"I hate you\" to your face\nNo coming back from where I'm going\nSky is dark, my soul is black, hand on the shovel\nDig with the blade of it then I step on the metal\nVendetta to settle, tell the Devil\nI'm leaving Heaven (Yeah)\nI'm leaving Heaven (You know, I should dig your motherfucking ass up)\nAngels won't find me (Just to spit in your fucking face)\nWhere I am going (Holding my baby pictures up like you're proud of me)\nI'm leaving Heaven (Fuck you, bitch)\nI'm leaving Heaven (You know what? Maybe if I hadn't had you)\nAngels won't find me (I wouldn't have went through half the shit I went through, so I blame you)\nWhere I am going (Or maybe I should say, \"Thank you\")\n('Cause I wouldn't have been me, haha)\n\nSo you better, you better run (Yeah)\nYou better, you better run (So I'ma let it go now, rest in peace)\nYou better, you better run (Cocksucker, haha)\nYou better, you better run (See you in Hell)86"

Why is winter cold?\nWhy is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?\nListen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets\nThis isn't golf, this is a blistering assault\nThose are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost\nShit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the Wizard of Oz\nWrap a lizard in gauze\nBeat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws\nAnd cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls\nThrow you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws\nSo sip piss like sizzurp through a straw\nThen describe how it tasted like dessert to us all\nGot the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers\nTickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog\n(You're on fire)\nThat's how you know you're on a roll\n'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold\n(You're on fire)\nMan, I'm so fuckin' sick\nI got ambulances pullin' me over and shit\n(You're on fire)\nYou need to stop, drop, and roll\n'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow\n(You're on fire) Yeah\n(You're on fire) Yuh\n\nI just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses\nIf you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song\nIt's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook\nThat the crook just took over, so book\nRun as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it\nI'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan\nI pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan\nMr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed\nBut I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can\nCome back and whip your ass with it again\nSaliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand\nIt'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man\nTurn him into plastic\nSo for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine\nYeah, ask Denaun, man\nHit a blind man with a coloring book\nAnd told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon\nFuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van\nAnd hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'\n\"Vietnam vet\", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man\nKick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him nine grand\nSo if I seem a little mean to you\nThis ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute\nYou wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route\nYou couldn't make a bulimic puke\nOn a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop\nSayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care\nAnd why the fuck am I yellin' at air?\nI ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there\nAnd nobody will fuckin' test me\n'Cause these hoes won't even dare\nI'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare\nI just thought of another one that might go here\nNah, don't waste it, save it, psycho\u2014yeah\nPlus you got to rewrite those lines\nThat you said about Michael's hair (Whoops!)\n\n(You're on fire)\nThat's how you know you're on a roll\n'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold\n(You're on fire)\nMan, I'm so- I'm so hot\nMy motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie\n(You're on fire)\nYou need to stop, drop, and roll\n'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow\n(You're on fire) Yeah\nOh, shit (You're on fire)76"

Kelly, I start ballin'\nMakin' it rain for the ladies in the minis\nBut I'm not throwin' ones, five, tens, or even twenties\nI'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies\nMan, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's\nFrom the North, East, and West\u2014\nBut when it comes to them trailers in them South-parks\nMuffle it, 'cause, homie, that hood's tighter than Kenny's\nSo, ladies, if your belly button's not an innie, then I'm outtie\nNow hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy\nCome on\n\nNow you can do this on your own\nBut everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\nSo get on the floor and grab somebody\nAin't nothin' but a white trash party (White trash party)\nSo let's have us a little bash\nAnd if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash\nYou don't know, you better ask somebody\n'Cause we're having a white trash party (White trash party)\nNow, whether you're black, white, or purple; if you're misunderstood\nBut you don't give a fuck, you ain't doin' shit that you should\nLong as you know you're up to evil, and you're no damn good\nGet on the floor, man, and rep your hood\n\nNow, honey, don't let them pricks trip\nWe should make a quick dip\nAnd go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot\n'Cause, girl, I got a sick whip\nKick the back window out of my Gremlin\nPut two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift\nAnd make a five-seater, I'll be damned if I feed a chick\nIt ain't like me to split a piece of dry pita\nI be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y\nAnd I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater\nI'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down\n'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown\nI'll tell you now, I'm so raw, I still need to unthaw\nYou feel me, y'all? I shut the club down like Drake in the mall\nBut baby, a body like that's against the law\nYou the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw\nColeslaw containers, empty straw wrappers, and all\nYou got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car\nNow get up\n\nNow you can do this on your own\nBut everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\nSo get on the floor and grab somebody\nAin't nothin' but a white trash party\nSo let's have us a little bash\nAnd if anyone asks, it ain't no one but us trash\nYou don't know, you better ask somebody\n'Cause we're having a white trash party (White trash party)81"

I am finally realizin' I need\nHelp, can't do it myself, too weak\nTwo weeks, I've been havin' ups and downs\nGoin' through peaks and valleys\nDilly-dallyin' 'round with the idea\nOf endin' this shit right here, I'm hatin' my reflection\nI walk around the house tryna fight mirrors\nI can't stand what I look like, yeah\nI look fat, but what do I care? I give a fuck\nOnly thing I fear's Hailie\nI'm afraid if I close my eyes\nThat I might see her... Shit\nI'm going through changes\nI'm going through changes\n\nI lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon\nYeah, Dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you\nMarshall, what happened that you can't stop with these pills?\nAnd you've fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin' at you\nIt become a problem you're too pussy to tackle? Get up\nBe a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled\nKnow you just had your heart ripped out and crushed\nThey say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust\nNah, it ain't like Doody to do that, he wouldn't fuckin'\nShoot at nobody, he'd fight first, but dwellin'\nOn it only makes the night worse, now I'm poppin' Vics, Percs\nAnd Methadone pills, \"Yeah, Em, tight verse\nYou killed it!\" Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes men\nAnd they gon' do whatever I says when I says it\nIt's in their best interest to protect their investment\nAnd I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then\u2014\n\n(I'm going through changes) Don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do\n(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes\n\nMy friends can't understand this new me, that's understandable\nMan, but think how bananas you'd be, you'd be an animal too\nIf you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo\nAnd everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do?\nI'm startin' to live like a recluse\nAnd the truth is, fame's startin' to give me an excuse\nTo be at an all-time low; I sit alone in my home theater\nWatchin' the same damn DVD of the\nFirst tour; the last tour, he was still alive\nAnd it hurts so I fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright\nAnd if I'm still awake in the middle of the night\nI'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfuckin' right\nI ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound\nAlmost in a coma, yeah homie, come on, dole 'em out!\n\"Daddy, don't you die on me! Daddy, better hold your ground!\"\nFuck, don't I know the sound of that voice? Yeah, baby, hold me down (Daddy!)\n\n(I'm going through changes) (Daddy!) Don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do\n(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes\n\nWake up in the hospital, full of tubes\nBut somehow I'm pullin' through\nSwear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof\nI'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few\nFacts, 'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth\nShit, it just hit me that what if I would not've made it through?\nI think about the things I would'a never got to say to you\nI'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do\nHailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too\nI still love your mother, that'll never change\nThink about her every day\nWe just could never get it together, hey\nWish there was a better way for me to say it\nBut I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day\nThere are just too many things to explain\nWhen it rains, guess it pours \u2014 yes, it does\nWish there wasn't any pain, but I can't pretend there ain't\nI ain't placin' any blame\nI ain't pointin' fingers, Heaven knows I've never been a saint\nI know that it feels like we just pissed away our history\nAnd just today I looked at your picture, almost if to say\nI miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way\nBut I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say\nI guess I'm\u2014\n(I'm going through changes) Don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do\n(I'm going through changes) But I just keep on going through changes95"

Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me\nDid me a favor though, my spirit free you've set\nBut a special place for you in my heart I have kept\nIt's unfortunate, but it's\u2014\n\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, twenty-five to life\n(Yeah, can't take no more)\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, twenty-five to life\n\nI feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh\n'Cause that ain't good enough\nYou expect me to fold myself in half till I snap\nDon't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap\nHow can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that\nDon't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?\nJealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still?\nMan, I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers\nI'm divorcing you \u2013 go marry someone else and make 'em famous!\nAnd take away their freedom like you did to me\nTreat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you\nFeed 'em the same shit that you made me eat\nI'm moving on, forget you\nOh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you\nAll I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch\nChew me up and spit me out, I fell for this\nSo many times it's ridiculous\nAnd still I stick with this, I'm sick of this\nBut in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get\nEvil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em\nMy friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from\nI'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama, I'm drawn to\nShit, I guess I'm a mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I\nAin't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss\nYou're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed\nBut when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list\nFuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you, my life sentence is served, bitch\nAnd it's just\u2014\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, twenty-five to life\n(I'm gone, man)\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, twenty-five to life\nToo late\nCaught in a chase, twenty-five to life112"

Chang's sauce?\nGame's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls\nYou think I'm backin' down?\nYou must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous\n\nYou dream of trading places, I have been changing faces\nYou cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose\nWake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless\nThere is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes\nI just wanna be famous, but...\nBe careful what you wish for\n\nI'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again\nI'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen\nMetaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory\nSome I wrote on a napkin, I do what I have to to win\nPullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's\nNot even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?\nAnd tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko\n'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern and smash it on his porch\nNow get off my dick! 'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick\nGet off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!\nDon't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer\nI just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer\nI just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast\nBeat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer\nY'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes\nSee, he's in a whole nother weight class\nHe's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets\nYou're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's\nLaughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties\nNo peace treaties, he's turned into a beast\nHis new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E\nHe's almost famous\nYou dream of trading places, I have been changing faces\nYou cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose\nWake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless\nThere is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes\nI just wanna be famous, but...\nBe careful what you wish for\n\nNow there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls\nScreamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls\nSpewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads\nHe ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard\nHe'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark\nWith the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, \"Ahh!\"\nThese metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all\nIf they don't like it, they can all get fucked\nInstead of suckin' him off\nThey can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by\nLike David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die\nAnd eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it\nHe's mad at the whole world\nSo go to hell and build a snowman, girl\nThe bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed\nThen they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me\n'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'\nWho coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?\nAnd while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar\nHigher than my opinion of these women's been lowered\nSo bear witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'\nThis world ain't gonna know what hit it\nHe did it, he made it, he's finally famous61"

There won't be no next time!\nI apologize, even though I know it's lies\nI'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her\nTo the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna\u2014\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn?\nWell, that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry?\nWell, that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie303"

Bitch, I do this all for the sport only\nBut I want it all, I'm not just talkin' awards, homie\nAnd the ball's in my court and it's lonely\nOn top of the world, when you're the only one\nWith the balls in your shorts\nTo leave their jaws on the floors with no remorse\n'Member that when they get to doggin' you boy, homie\nSo y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna\nI'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi\nI'm moppin' the floors with 'em, I keep tryna pass it, but they keep on\nDroppin' the torch and it won't be long 'til this sport is O-V-\n-E-R, just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors and no, we\nAin't pumpkins on Halloween, but we'll show up on your porch, so be\nCareful what you say, there ain't no punks over here, so follow me\nThrough the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P, let me guide you through the smoke, G\nIf only I wasn't travelin' down this road by my lonely\nNo one who knew me like you will ever know me\nI don't think you understand how much you meant to me\nThe days are cold, livin' without you\nThe nights are long, I'm growin' older\nI miss the days of old, thinkin' about you\nYou may be gone, but you're never over\n\nAnd it don't stop, oh-oh\nAnd it don't quit, oh-oh\nAnd it don't stop, oh-oh\nAnd it don't quit, oh-oh\nAnd I miss you, oh-oh\nI just miss you, oh-oh\nI just miss you, oh-oh\nHomie, I'll never forget you, no\n\nFor you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life\nSo sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the \"dyna\" in \"mite\"\nYeah, it'll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself\nTap dancin' all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself\nGuess that the best thing I can do right now, Doody, for you is to rep\nSo I'm gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death\nAnd instead of mournin' your death, I'd rather celebrate your life\nElevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics\n'Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight, everything I can just do right\nThere's nothin' that I can do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype\nJust finish the rhyme and I bust it, excuse the corny metaphor\nBut they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered\nSo God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process\nTryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous\nBut this depression ain't takin' me hostage, I've been patiently watchin'\nThis game, pacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always\nProof, you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes\nCome right back on their asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards\nAnd I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes\nI'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em\nHomie, I know I'm never gonna be the same without you\nI never woulda came in this game, I'm goin' insane without you\nMatter fact, it was just the other night had another dream about you\nYou told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew\nYou gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you\nYou told me, \"Naw, Doody, you're not!\"; layin' on that table, I knew\nI was gonna make it; soon as you said, \"Think of Hailie\" I knew\nThere wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies; and Proof\nNot many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you\nLord, I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do\nJust grant me the strength that I need for one more day to get through\nSo, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you\nI love you, Doody\n\nThe days are cold, livin' without you\nThe nights are long, I'm growin' older\nI miss the days of old, thinkin' about you\nYou may be gone, but you're never over\n\nAnd it don't stop, oh-oh\nAnd it don't quit, oh-oh\nAnd it don't stop, oh-oh\nAnd it don't quit, oh-oh\nAnd I miss you, oh-oh\nI just miss you, oh-oh\nI just miss you, oh-oh\nHomie, I'll never forget you, no46"

Yeah\nYou ready to get this shit started or what?\nAight, well, I brought some friends with me too\n\nNow I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin' I'm back\nI could relax, but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks\nCouple Xanax, light a couple wax candles, then black-\n-out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac (Woo!)\nBurp bubbles, attitude's immaturin', double\nShot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin'\u2014 woah-ho\nI can't see shit, my words get to slurrin'\u2014 uh-oh!\nYou can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!\nWhat's occurrin' before, after, and durin' the show\nHas no bearin' on the bad news I'm bearin', woah\nWhat is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushin' you out the do'\nSo suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow\nNow stomp your fuckin' feet 'til you get to squishing a ho\nIt's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh\nDamn, baby, you look good, you're givin' me wood\nYou should pull over like a sweatshirt wit' a hood (Woo!)\nIt's neck work, get our polly on, you and me both\nBreak bread while I'm coppin' over this game to pinch a loaf\nNow, homie, who's your favorite pain in the ass? Who claims to be\nSpittin' the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed\nIn other words, I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas\nDestroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash\nWent through 'em and laughed, came back an hour after the accident\nAnd bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!\nSo stop fakin' the funk and start shakin' your ass\nSlaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap\nAnd Just Blaze on the track, what the fuck's more amazin' than that\nSlut? Answer me that! Royce, where you at?\nI'm right here, Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers, I pry apart you\nLump on your head designed by a barstool (Come on!)\nDesigned by a cartoon\nBefore I need to be hired, Jimmy, I'll fire Marshall (Woah!)\nThe 9 tucked against the linin'\nI pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69ing (Ha)\nIt's like Rick James is shootin' up your house, nigga!\nFuck yo' couch, nigga!\nYou screamin', \"Fuck the world!\" with your middle finger up\nWhile I'm over here shovin' my dick in a hole in the mud\nMy bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder\nBecause I murdered her, so you can call me Nicole to O. J. to Glove (Woo!)\nI got a posse of insane clowns\nBlow your brains on your opposite ear and ask you how your brain sounds\nBad, Evil, we go Alfred E. Neumann\nMad cerebral, you on your last burrito!\n(What that mean, Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eatin'\nGet a beat, then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern\nSlaughterhouse on fire, nobody touchin' that\nGood day and good night! Ortiz, yo, where the fuck you at? (Yaowa)\n\nI'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years (Uh)\nAhead of my mic peers (Yeah), quite scary to look at, a nightmare\nWhere my book at? I'll write fear in the heart of you tight squares\nI harbor the art of you nice wear (Ah!)\nIt's type weird 'cause that made me hotter than my dear (Uh)\nUncle Al's breath after polishin' off his ninth beer (Haha!)\nHomie, chill, listen, I swear\nI'm god, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears (Ow!)\nI'm right here, why wouldn't I be? Just waiting to be hooked to IV\nAs Mumm-Ra's well, when you look at my pee (Ew)\nAnd this joint (No exception), so just point (A direction)\nAnd record the pig's oink (When I rip his intestines)\nThis isn't just an infection (Nah)\nThis won't go away with penicillin injections (Tss)\nMillions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit (What?)\nSeems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it (Ow!)\nAw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen\nI emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Edeminem (Haha)\nSo tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgusting hook (Yeah)\nJump in shark water and swim! Yo, where the fuck is Crook?\n\nI'm right here, lettin' the shotty pop, quick as a karate chop\nGet your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop\nCall it Maserati drop, in the body shop\nGet your mommy knocked and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped (Yeah)\nI take your life to the ninth innin'\nA knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winnin'\nI laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny\nI'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money (Yo!)\nMan, all the bitches holla\u2014 they wanna drop my britches\nThen jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala\nI ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas (Uh)\nAs soon as I draw, get sent to Allah\nBilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun\nI'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn\nI pillage your village for fun, an egregious con\nA syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam! (Brrat!)\nSlaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flying\nWe do it to try to do without tryin' (Slaughterhouse!)\n'Cause to it's us it's so easy\nWhere's \"Jumpoff\" Joe Beezy?26"
